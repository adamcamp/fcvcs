This page was created to advocate for a public virtual schooling option in Frederick County, MD

When the grade 3-8 Remote Virtual Program was shut down at FCPS, many parents and students were left distraught by the lack of quality public school options in Frederick County. While in person classrooms are ideal for many students, others find it hard to focus in chaotic 30+ child classrooms.

The purpose of this page is raise awareness for this critical issue in hopes that one day a Virtual Charter School could be setup in Frederick County to meet the needs of these students.
