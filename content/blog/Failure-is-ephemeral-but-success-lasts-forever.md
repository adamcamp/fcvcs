Success is like a giant snowball cratering downhill into an avalanche. The more you see success the more you want success. The more you want success the more success you achieve. And if you achieve success then that success will last forever. 

Nothing can stop an avalanche. Sometimes it just takes a tiny failure to feel like a snowball, but remember you are no snowball. You are an avalanche in training.
