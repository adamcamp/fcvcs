### My student did horrible during COVID why do you want to bring virtual back?

The virtual school is not intended for students who well served in an in person setting. There are a minority of students who thrive in a virtual setting who cannot do well in person. The school is intended for students who want to learn virtually, and are able to excel in the virtual environment.

In fact, many virtual programs preceded COVID and continued after COVID for a variety of reasons. When people think virtual they think COVID but virtual as a special education resource is a different concept entirely.

### Why can't families just home school their kids?

For many kids home schooling is a viable option because they have a parent at home who is highly engaged in their learning and actively managing their teaching. For the rest of students, the public education system is there. When we say virtual schooling we're talking about a school where there are teachers actively teaching the students and the parents can be working from home in another room. There is no active involvement required from the parents except to make sure the student is attending class. 

Virtual schooling is very different from home schooling because there are teachers and a principal. It's really more like traditional schooling in a home environment than it is similar to home schooling.
