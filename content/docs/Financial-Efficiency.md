One might ask how a virtual program with 12:1 student teacher ratios could be afforded in a public school system where typical classroom sizes are generally greater than 30 students. What it comes down to is per-pupil allocation and reduction of overhead.

> The Per-Pupil Foundation Amount increases from $8,310 for each student in the 2022-2023 school year to $8,642 for each student in the 2023-2024 school year, with increases continuing all the way up to $12,365 for each student in the 2032-2033 school year.\

The answer is to allocate the entire Per-Pupil Foundation Amount directly to the FTEs that are meeting student education needs.

1. Eliminate facilities
2. Eliminate non-educational staff
3. Eliminate extra curricular activities
4. Eliminate all non-essential spending

If all the money is spent on FTE's serving the students needs then you can hire a lot more teachers.

Sample Budget for 160 students:

$8642 x 160 - Students

\= 1.38 million

$150,000 x 1 - Principal

\+

$90,000 x 13 - Teachers

\= $1.32 million

What about special needs?

The beauty of the Per-Pupil Foundation Amount is that it doesn't have to cover special needs because any special needs education amounts would be "layered" on top of the foundation amount.
