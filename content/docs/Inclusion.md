Inclusion has been the goal for a long time in the public school system. Acts like the "No Child Left Behind Act" and the "Every Student Succeeds Act" ensure funding to help students with special needs. This additional funding is typically used to bring extra teachers into the school to help the struggling students either inside of the classroom (push-in) or outside of the classroom (pull-out).

Push-in and pull-out techniques have been the standard way to address special needs for decades, but they are not always effective. Some of the inherent flaws of these techniques are that:

* Large classrooms can be a distraction for some students meaning that push-in techniques can be ineffective and can still lead to students falling behind.
* A pull-out strategy can be implemented to help the student catch up, but anytime spent being pulled-out of the classroom means that the student is missing out on the teaching that their peers are attending. This can mean the student is falling more behind as they try to catch up.
* Being pulled out of the classroom for extra help can make the student feel disconnected from his peers, and can also lead to bullying.

Students who are distracted often become disruptive to others. In very large classrooms, these students actions can lead to chain reactions and cause entire classes to become unruly. Sometimes removing these kids from the classroom can help restore the peace, but removing an agitated child on the spectrum can also cause them to become even more agitated. At that point a lot of schools seem to turn to seclusion and/or restraints - which can inflict lifetime trauma on these pour souls.

The problem with all of these techniques is that they're centered around a classroom which has over the years become more crowded and more unruly. In a lot of classrooms today, it is hard for the most studious and attentive kids to pay attention, much less a child with ADHD. For these students that do well in the classroom, that's great. Some students just don't belong there.

Which brings us back to the topic of inclusion - sometimes equality is not the same as equity. Every person is an individual and each individual has their own unique needs. Some students do well in classrooms, others do not. To bring students who excel in a classroom environment together with students who simply cannot learn in such an environment is equal treatment but it is not equitable.

To be equitable, every student must be given conditions in which they are able to thrive. Think about a cactus from the desert and a rubber tree from a rainforest. Equality is planting both of these right next to each other. Problem is by planting a cactus, which prefers dry conditions, next to a rubber tree which prefers wet conditions, you're guaranteeing that at least one will fail. Equity in this case would be planting the cactus in the desert and the rubber tree in the rainforest. By planting each plant where they are able to thrive, we are ensuring that both plants have a strong chance of success.

Same principle goes for education. If some students do well in a classroom then put them in a classroom. If others do better in a virtual setting why should this option not be available to them? Sometimes to be equitable we have to be unequal just as sometimes being equal can be inequitable. What matters is not that students get the same opportunities, but that the students are given the same chance to thrive in conditions that work for them personally.

### What about virtual schooling?

Virtual schooling has a number of benefits for students with special needs.

1. Students who are distracted can go on mute. This means the cascading distractions which travels contagiously through classrooms are few and far between. Eventually the student will regain focus and come back into the fold, but the important part is they don't impact any of their peers while distracted so the effects of their distraction don't reverberate.
2. Homes can be optimized for distractions. Being in a room by themselves means that there is much less to trigger a child's mind to wander.
3. Breakout rooms provide a lot of flexibility offering kind of a gray area between push-in and pull-out techniques. Students don't have to feel singled out or different when all the kids go to breakout room at the same time.
4. Scheduling flexibility offers time for students to catch up without falling more behind. Putting a "power block" into the schedule means that students have time to catch up during the school day without missing out on any lessons.
5. Students with medical needs that prevent them from attending a physical classroom can also benefit from virtual. Rather than being taught in an isolated manner by a home hospital teacher, they can join a classroom full of eager learners where they can make friends and be part of a group.
